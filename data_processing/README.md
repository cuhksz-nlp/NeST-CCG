## Data Pre-processing

You need to obtain the official [CCGbank](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2005T13) by yourself and put the folder LDC05T13 under this directory.

Run `./data_processing.sh` under this directory to split and process the CCGbank.

After you run getdata.sh, you will see the processed data in the [`../data`](../data) directory.
